'Standard index units are index tag units, heading tag units, equation tag units, figure tag units and theorem units.'

'The compiled result of an index unit consists of four parts: tag, mark, desc and content. The tag part is from global tag option of the tag or the tag. The mark part is from mark option or the index. The desc part is from desc option. The content part is from the children.'
[]
{h1 [Index Tag Unit]}
Index tag units are most basic index units.
[]
Index tag units are compiled in inline mode by default which can be changed by "block" option.

Adding "no-tag" class can hide the tag part. Adding "capitalize-tag" class can capitalize the tag part.
[]
{h1 [Heading Tag Unit]}
The tag part of a heading tag unit is hided.
